# Prosensia Internship Tasks  
A collection of C++ programs submitted as part of my internship onboarding.

#Day 1 Tasks:

1.cpp - Hello World
A minimal C++ program to verify the development environment.
Key Concept: Basic program structure and output.

2.cpp - Age Input
Captures user input (age) and displays it back.
Key Concept: Variable declaration and cin/cout usage.

3.cpp - Student Information System
Takes multiple inputs (name, age, GPA) and formats the output.
Key Concept: Handling mixed data types (string, int, float).

#Day 2 Tasks:

Take input of marks for 3 subjects:
  - Mathematics
  - English
  - Physics
- Each subject has a maximum of **100 marks**
- Calculate:
  - **Total marks** out of 300
  - **Average percentage**
  - **Grade** based on the following criteria:

| Grade | Average (%)    |
|-------|----------------|
| A     | 80 â€“ 100       |
| B     | 70 â€“ 79        |
| C     | 60 â€“ 69        |
| Fail  | Less than 60   |

ðŸ’» Sample Output
Enter your marks in given subjects (Each subject has 100 marks)
Enter obtained marks in Mathematics:
85
Enter obtained marks in English:
74
Enter obtained marks in Physics:
90
Total Marks = 249/300
Average = 83%
Grade: A

Day 3 Task Completed: C++ Program for Eligibility Check

ðŸ”¹ Developed a C++ program that takes user's Name, Age, and CGPA as input.
ðŸ”¹ Applied conditional logic to check if the user is eligible (Age â‰¥ 18 and CGPA â‰¥ 2.5).
ðŸ”¹ Added detailed output to explain the reason if the user is not eligible.
ðŸ”¹ Practiced usage of logical operators (&&), input/output, and if/else statements.

ðŸ“Œ Task Objective: Strengthen basics of input handling, conditions, and logical thinking in C++.


Day 4 Task Completed: C++ Programs for Integer Reversal and Prime Check

ðŸ”¹ Implemented a C++ program to reverse an integer using a loop with edge case handling (0, negative, and large numbers).
ðŸ”¹ Wrote a second program to check whether a given number is prime, using efficient loop logic up to sqrt(n).
ðŸ”¹ Added comments to explain the logic clearly in both programs.
ðŸ”¹ Validated edge cases as instructed: 0, 1, negative values, and large inputs.

ðŸ“Œ Task Objective: Practice loops, conditionals, and number operations in C++.                                      

Day 5 Completed
ðŸ”¹ Task Overview:
Today, I implemented three logical functions in C++:

Recursive Factorial â€“ Handled input constraints to prevent overflow.

Conditional Max Logic â€“ Compared 3 values with tie-handling rules.

Banner & Execution Flow â€“ Ensured clean and user-friendly output display.

ðŸ”§ Concepts Practiced:
âœ” Recursion
âœ” Conditional Statements (if-else)
âœ” Input/Output Formatting
âœ” Function Design & Reusability

ðŸ’¡ What I Learned:
I gained deeper understanding of how to design clean recursive functions with safeguards, and how to apply logical conditions to handle ties and edge cases in value comparisons.

ðŸ’» C++ is becoming more intuitive as I continue solving real-world logic problems step by step!
