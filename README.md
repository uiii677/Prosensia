# Prosensia Internship Tasks  
A collection of C++ programs submitted as part of my internship onboarding.

#Day 1 Tasks:

1.cpp - Hello World
A minimal C++ program to verify the development environment.
Key Concept: Basic program structure and output.

2.cpp - Age Input
Captures user input (age) and displays it back.
Key Concept: Variable declaration and cin/cout usage.

3.cpp - Student Information System
Takes multiple inputs (name, age, GPA) and formats the output.
Key Concept: Handling mixed data types (string, int, float).

#Day 2 Tasks:

Take input of marks for 3 subjects:
  - Mathematics
  - English
  - Physics
- Each subject has a maximum of **100 marks**
- Calculate:
  - **Total marks** out of 300
  - **Average percentage**
  - **Grade** based on the following criteria:

| Grade | Average (%)    |
|-------|----------------|
| A     | 80 – 100       |
| B     | 70 – 79        |
| C     | 60 – 69        |
| Fail  | Less than 60   |

💻 Sample Output
Enter your marks in given subjects (Each subject has 100 marks)
Enter obtained marks in Mathematics:
85
Enter obtained marks in English:
74
Enter obtained marks in Physics:
90
Total Marks = 249/300
Average = 83%
Grade: A

Day 3 Task Completed: C++ Program for Eligibility Check

🔹 Developed a C++ program that takes user's Name, Age, and CGPA as input.
🔹 Applied conditional logic to check if the user is eligible (Age ≥ 18 and CGPA ≥ 2.5).
🔹 Added detailed output to explain the reason if the user is not eligible.
🔹 Practiced usage of logical operators (&&), input/output, and if/else statements.

📌 Task Objective: Strengthen basics of input handling, conditions, and logical thinking in C++.


Day 4 Task Completed: C++ Programs for Integer Reversal and Prime Check

🔹 Implemented a C++ program to reverse an integer using a loop with edge case handling (0, negative, and large numbers).
🔹 Wrote a second program to check whether a given number is prime, using efficient loop logic up to sqrt(n).
🔹 Added comments to explain the logic clearly in both programs.
🔹 Validated edge cases as instructed: 0, 1, negative values, and large inputs.

📌 Task Objective: Practice loops, conditionals, and number operations in C++.                                      

Day 5 Completed
🔹 Task Overview:
Today, I implemented three logical functions in C++:

Recursive Factorial – Handled input constraints to prevent overflow.

Conditional Max Logic – Compared 3 values with tie-handling rules.

Banner & Execution Flow – Ensured clean and user-friendly output display.

🔧 Concepts Practiced:
✔ Recursion
✔ Conditional Statements (if-else)
✔ Input/Output Formatting
✔ Function Design & Reusability

💡 What I Learned:
I gained deeper understanding of how to design clean recursive functions with safeguards, and how to apply logical conditions to handle ties and edge cases in value comparisons.

💻 C++ is becoming more intuitive as I continue solving real-world logic problems step by step!

Day 6 Completed

🧮 Task: Array Analysis and Reordering
🔧 Concepts Practiced:

1D Arrays

Function Creation & Parameter Passing

Conditional Logic & Looping

Manual Array Reordering (Even/Odd)

Index Tracking

📝 Day 7 – Completed
Today’s task focused on character-level string manipulation in C++. The program takes a single-word input, ensures no spaces, converts it to lowercase manually, and performs the following:

Reverse the string without using reverse()

Check for palindrome using index-based comparison

Count vowels, skipping repeated consecutive vowels

This challenge improved my understanding of manual string handling, logic building, and edge case validation without relying on STL shortcuts

Day 8 Completed
🔍 Topic: Pointer Labyrinth – Conditional Swapping & Array Traversal

📌 What I Did:
✔ Implemented pointer-based logic for conditional swapping (only if the absolute difference > 10)
✔ Traversed and printed an array using pointer arithmetic
✔ Found the first even number in an array via pointer
✔ Incremented all odd numbers directly through address manipulation

💡 What I Learned:
Mastered pointer fundamentals including swapping via dynamic memory, pointer traversal, and logic without using STL or indexing.
